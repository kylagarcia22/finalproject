    <h1>Body Dismorphic Disorder (BDD)</h1>
    <p>Body image disorder is characterized by persistent and intrusive preoccupations with an imagined or slight defect in one's appearance.
The flaw is usually insignificant but those who suffer from BDD view their flaws as significant and prominent, often causing severe emotional distress and difficulties in daily functioning.<br>
BDD mostly develops in adolescents and teens. Research shows that it affects men and women almost equally. About one percent of the U.S. population has BDD.<br>
It is important to note that not everyone who deals with body image issues suffers from a mental disorder. Please keep this mind as you read the rest of this page.
